# Disney-Movies-and-Box-Office-Success

## Exploring Disney movie data, and building a linear regression model to predict box office success.

Since the 1930s, Walt Disney Studios has released more than 600 films covering a wide range of genres. While some movies are indeed directed towards kids, many are intended for a broad audience. In this project, we will analyze data to see how Disney movies have changed in popularity since its first movie release. We will also perform hypothesis testing to see what aspects of a movie contribute to its success.

In this project, we'll manipulate data using pandas and make basic plots using Seaborn. We will also perform two-sample bootstrap hypothesis tests for difference of means.

The dataset used in this project is a modified version of the Disney Character Success dataset from [Kelly Garrett](https://data.world/kgarrett/disney-character-success-00-16).
